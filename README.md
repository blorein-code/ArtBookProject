# ArtBookProject

I have used Core Data to save input where written from text label. 
I have used AppDelegate to connection with Core Data.
I have used Gesture Recognizer for when I need to catch who tapped something.
I have used UIImagePicker when I need to sense user interaction finished from photo library and when I need to create new image picker
I have used fetch request when I need to get data from core data
I have used UUID because of when I need to filter with id when I did fetch request to get data from Core Data
